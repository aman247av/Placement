## Object
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. An Object can be defined as an instance of a class ~ "Each object has its own set of characterstics and behaviors as defined by the class."

## Class
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. It is a blueprint for creating objects. Class is a user defined data type.

### What is the need for OOPs?
The concept of “objects” allows the OOPs model to easily access, use and modify the instance data and methods, interact with other objects, and define methods in runtime (during the execution of the program)

#### Package is a bundle of classes
- Scanner in Util package.
- ArrayList in util
- Java Lang is default package.

## Encapsulation
It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit - like class. It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.

## Primitive types (e.g. int, float)  vs  Reference types (e.g. String, Account, Book)
- Each element in an array is initialized to 0 (for primitive types) or null (for reference types)

## Access Modifier:
Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application.
- **public:** Accessible everywhere.
- **protected:** Accessible within the same package and by subclasses (including subclasses declared outside the package).
- **private:** Accessible only within the defining class.
- **default (no modifier):** Accessible within the same class and package.

## Message Passing
Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other.
